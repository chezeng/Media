### **What Is the Role of the Board of Directors? The Relationship Between the CEO and the Board**

#### **1. What Is the Board of Directors?**

- The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is a “decision-making and oversight team” composed of several directors. They typically represent the interests of shareholders, oversee company operations, and provide guidance to the CEO and executive team.
- **Main Functions:**
    - **Supervising the company’s direction:** Ensuring the CEO and executive team’s strategies align with shareholder interests.
    - **Hiring/firing the CEO:** If the CEO underperforms, the Board has the authority to replace them.
    - **Approving major decisions:** Significant matters like large-scale acquisitions or going public require the Board’s approval.
    - **Protecting shareholder interests:** Acting in the shareholders’ best interests to ensure the company’s healthy development.

#### **2. The Relationship Between the CEO and the Board**

- **The CEO reports to the Board:** While the CEO handles day-to-day operations, their strategic direction must be reported to and approved by the Board, which has ultimate oversight.
- **The Board ≠ Management Team:** The Board focuses on “steering the ship,” while the management team is responsible for “rowing the ship.” Their roles are distinct.
- **The Board can replace the CEO:** If the company performs poorly or the CEO makes poor decisions, the Board has the authority to replace them.

### **Summary: How a Company Operates**

1. The Board of Directors acts as the “guardian” and “overseer,” ensuring that the company’s direction is correct from a shareholder perspective.
2. The CEO leads the company, executing strategies approved by the Board.
3. The CFO manages finances, the CTO manages technology, and other executives oversee their respective areas (e.g., the COO handles operations, the CMO handles marketing, etc.).
4. The Board doesn’t manage daily operations but has the final say on major decisions, such as going public or mergers and acquisitions.

**In simple terms:** The CEO and the executive team are like the “team running on the field,” while the Board is like the “referees in the stands.” However, the referees can decide to replace the team captain (the CEO).
