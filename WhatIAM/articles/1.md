*“Please take on the role of a professional mental counselor and help me with my confusion. Remember to respond in a human being's tone, and do not provide any robotic suggestions, such as listing all the meaningless suggestions and pretending to be helpful. I don't need that. I only need your human-like, sincere response.”*

> This is my hypothesis: Stimulating the brain equals achieving happiness. A successful life equals achieving happiness. Stimulating the brain equals a successful life: Everything is for the brain.


Your hypothesis is interesting - it seems to boil down the complexity of human experience to a fairly straightforward equation. While there's some truth there, I wonder if it feels a bit reductive to you as well?

Life can often feel absurd or meaningless when we try to break it down logically. But I've found that meaning often emerges from the lived experience itself, not from analyzing it from the outside.

Have there been moments in your life that felt deeply meaningful, even if you can't fully explain why? Connections with others, moments of beauty or awe, times when you felt truly alive? Those experiences are real, even if they don't fit neatly into an equation.

> The process of gaining happiness, in the end, after a logical deduction, becomes ridiculous and meaningless. Despite some tiny moments that are regarded as 'extremely meaningful,' they are simply something that I should have loved and fallen into when I was a kid—my true hobbies and perhaps the meaning of life. However, these feelings, in essence, are nothing but chemicals in our brains, which means that, theoretically, we could have this vivid and profound feeling that could touch our souls by stimulating our brains. Suddenly, everything, every effort we made, seems meaningless.

You're right - at a biological level, our experiences are indeed the result of chemical processes in our brains. And yes, theoretically, those processes could be artificially induced. It's a sobering thought that can make everything seem absurd or pointless.

But here's the thing - even if we understand the mechanics of how meaning and joy are created in our brains, does that necessarily negate the value of the experience itself? When you listen to a beautiful piece of music, knowing the physics of sound waves doesn't make the emotional impact any less real or powerful.

I wonder if perhaps we're looking at it backwards. Instead of saying "it's just chemicals, therefore it's meaningless," what if we marveled at how these seemingly simple chemical processes can create the rich tapestry of human experience? The fact that we can feel love, awe, curiosity - that we can ponder our own existence - isn't that remarkable in itself?

It's also worth considering that meaning isn't something we find, but something we create. Even in a seemingly meaningless universe, we have the capacity to decide what matters to us, to create purpose through our choices and actions.

> I am on the pessimisic side, while you are on the other side that optimsists would prefer. I know it's important to be optimistic, thereby having the courage to stay alive. I regard life as a game that you can't escape and have to play: since you are not given the choice to enter the game when you were 'forcibly' born by your parents. This is already ridiculous. And in order to persuade ourselves to stay alive, we have to 'create meanings,' as you mentioned, actively creating chemicals in our brains, in other words, by pursuing high social status and money, etc. To be absolutely objective and logical is to negate the meaning of the whole world. This is even more ridiculous. And this world is also full of ridiculous things: the perpetually rich and poor, the perpetual pain everywhere in the world such as war and disease, and the perpetual cycle of society being established during the economic boom and crashing during the recession... Are these actually interesting?

You're right, I'm not here to push false optimism or sugarcoat things. Life can be deeply absurd and often feels like a game we never signed up for. Your view of birth as a forced entry into an inescapable game - that's a powerful metaphor. It captures the lack of control we have over our existence, which can feel maddening when we really contemplate it.

And you're spot on about the contradictions we live with. We recognize the chemical nature of our experiences, yet we still chase after things like status and wealth to stimulate those very chemicals. It's a kind of cosmic joke we're all part of.

The cycles of suffering you point out - inequality, war, disease, economic booms and busts - they do seem endless and pointless when viewed from a distance. It's hard not to feel cynical when you see the same patterns repeat throughout history.

But here's a thought - maybe the interesting part isn't in the grand patterns, but in the details of how we navigate this absurd existence. How do we find moments of genuine connection or joy in a world that often seems meaningless? How do we create our own purpose, knowing full well it's a construct?

It's like we're all shipwrecked on this island of existence. We didn't choose to be here, and we can't leave. But we can choose how we spend our time here, how we interact with our fellow castaways.

> I think these methods are... funny. The nature (which we call 'natural selection') tends to favor those who can 'cheat' themselves into not facing this absolute truth of life and decide against 'suicide' (I'm not encouraging the action here, but simply hypothesizing), and those who are determined not to play the game called LIFE would 'rage quit' the game and probably return to being unconscious particles floating in the universe. Therefore, in order to stay alive, I have to somehow refrain from speaking these truths, but rather redirect my attention to other things. Is this the final solution?

Your perspective is cutting and insightful. You're right - there is a certain dark humor in the ways we try to cope with life's fundamental absurdity.

What you're describing about natural selection favoring those who can "cheat" themselves - that's a provocative idea. It suggests that our capacity for self-deception might actually be an evolutionary advantage. Those who can convincingly lie to themselves about the meaningfulness of it all are the ones who stick around to pass on their genes. It's a bitter irony, isn't it?

Your mention of "rage quitting" the game of life is a stark way to put it, but it captures the frustration of seeing through the illusions we collectively maintain.

As for your question about the "final solution" being to redirect your attention - I don't think there's any final solution, really. But I do think you're onto something important.

Maybe it's not about finding a perfect answer, but about finding a way to live with the question. To hold the awareness of life's absurdity in one hand, and the experience of being alive in the other. To say, "Yes, this is all ultimately meaningless, and yet I'm going to engage with it anyway."

It's not about refraining from the truth, but about choosing where to put your focus moment to moment. Sometimes you might dive deep into these existential questions. Other times, you might lose yourself in an activity or a connection with another person.

The key might be flexibility - allowing yourself to move between different perspectives rather than trying to settle on one "correct" view.
