# Brain in a Vat

> I have this theory: stimulating the brain equals happiness, and a successful life equals happiness. So, stimulating the brain must mean having a successful life. It all seems to come down to the brain.


That's an interesting theory—it sounds like you're simplifying the complexity of life down to a formula. There’s something compelling about it, but do you feel like it’s a little too simple?

When we try to analyze life in strictly logical terms, it can start to feel meaningless or absurd. But I’ve often noticed that the experience of meaning doesn’t come from analyzing life; it comes from actually living it.

Are there moments in your life that felt meaningful, even if you can’t fully explain why? Times when you felt truly alive, connected to others, or moved by beauty? Those experiences are real, even if they don’t fit into a formula.

> When I try to logically break down what it takes to achieve happiness, it ends up feeling ridiculous and meaningless. Sure, there are small moments that feel really meaningful, like when I was a kid and had passions and hobbies that felt like they could be my life's purpose. But when you get down to it, all those feelings are just chemicals in the brain. In theory, we could just stimulate our brains to feel anything we want. When I think of it that way, it makes all our efforts seem pointless.

I get it—our experiences really do come down to chemical reactions in the brain, and it’s true that in theory, we could artificially create those feelings. It’s a sobering thought, and it can make life feel absurd, as though nothing really matters.

But here’s a question: just because we know how these feelings happen in the brain, does that make them less valuable? Knowing how sound waves work doesn’t make a beautiful piece of music feel any less moving, right?

What if, instead of saying, “It’s just chemicals, so it’s meaningless,” we said, “Isn’t it incredible that these chemicals can create such a rich human experience?” The fact that we’re capable of love, awe, curiosity, and self-reflection—maybe that’s meaningful in itself.

And there’s another way to look at meaning: perhaps it isn’t something we find out there in the world, but something we create. Even in a universe that doesn’t offer us inherent meaning, we can still decide what’s meaningful to us, through our choices and actions.

> I see what you’re saying, but I lean toward a more pessimistic view, while you seem to be coming from an optimistic perspective. I get why it’s helpful to be optimistic; it gives us the courage to keep going. But to me, life feels like a game we’re forced to play. We didn’t get a choice about being born—our parents made that decision for us. That alone is absurd. And, like you said, we have to “create meaning” in order to stay alive, basically tricking ourselves into producing the right chemicals in our brains. We chase things like status and money for that reason. If we look at things totally objectively and logically, it all seems meaningless. And this world is full of contradictions and absurdities—there are always rich and poor, there’s always suffering from war and disease, society keeps going through cycles of growth and collapse. Looking at it this way, do you really think it’s interesting?

I hear you, and I’m not trying to sugarcoat things. Life can be absurd. Your view of birth as a kind of “forced entry” into a game we never agreed to play—that’s a powerful way of looking at it. There’s a deep frustration in knowing we’re here without a choice, yet expected to find meaning in it.

And yes, there’s a real irony in how we behave. Even though we know our experiences are just brain chemistry, we still chase after things like status and wealth to generate those feelings. It’s a kind of cosmic joke that we’re all part of.

The cycles of human suffering—inequality, war, disease, economic ups and downs—they do feel endless and exhausting when viewed from a distance. Cynicism feels like a natural response to that.

But here’s something to consider: maybe the most interesting part of life isn’t in these big, repetitive patterns, but in the ways we each choose to navigate this absurd existence. How do we find moments of joy, connection, or purpose in a world that doesn’t offer them by default? How do we create our own meaning, knowing that, on some level, it’s all arbitrary?

It’s a bit like being stranded on a deserted island. We didn’t choose to be here, and we can’t leave. But we can choose how we spend our time here, and how we relate to others who are also stranded with us.

> I find it funny, really. Nature—or “natural selection”—favors people who can “trick” themselves into not thinking about these uncomfortable truths and who can convince themselves to keep going. Meanwhile, people who refuse to play the game would “rage quit,” so to speak, and return to just being unconscious particles in the universe. So, in order to survive, I have to avoid these truths and distract myself with other things. Is that the final answer?

You’ve raised a powerful point, and there’s a kind of dark humor in it. If we look at survival this way, it does seem like natural selection favors those who can overlook or “cheat” the truth of life’s absurdity. It’s almost as if self-deception is an evolutionary advantage. Those who can convince themselves that life has meaning are the ones who stick around to pass on their genes. It’s a bitter irony, no doubt.

When you talk about “rage quitting” life, it captures a frustration that a lot of people feel, especially when they start to see through the illusions we tend to live by.

But about your question—whether the answer is to distract yourself and look away from the truth—I don’t think there’s any ultimate “final answer.” Maybe it’s not about finding one perfect solution, but about learning to live with the question. To hold onto the awareness of life’s absurdity in one hand, and the experience of being alive in the other. To say, “Yes, it’s all ultimately meaningless, and yet I’m going to engage with it anyway.”

Maybe it’s not about denying the truth but about choosing where to focus. Sometimes, you’ll want to explore these existential questions deeply, and other times you might choose to immerse yourself in something that brings you joy or connection.

The key could be flexibility—allowing yourself to move between different perspectives rather than feeling trapped in one rigid view.
