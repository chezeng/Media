# What Freedom Truly Means

#### **Q: Hey, I’ve been struggling with the concept of freedom lately. Is it just being able to do what I want?**

**A:** That’s what many people think at first—that freedom means no restrictions, no limits, and doing whatever crosses your mind. But let me challenge that. What if I told you that true freedom isn’t about “doing whatever,” but about **“guiding yourself toward your own path”**?

#### **Q: Guiding yourself toward your own path? That sounds deeper than just ‘being free.’ What do you mean?**

**A:** Think of the word “freedom.” Break it down: “free” is easy to understand—it’s about independence, being unrestricted. But what about “dom”? It implies something structural, a domain, a framework of control.

Now think about “route” or “router” in tech terms—it means directing or guiding something along a certain path. Freedom isn’t just about removing barriers; it’s about **actively guiding yourself** toward a path that’s meaningful to you.

So, **freedom** isn’t the absence of structure or rules. It’s about **you creating your own structure and choosing your own rules.** It’s not about floating aimlessly in a sea of choices, but sailing with intention toward a destination you truly believe in.

#### **Q: Wow. So, it’s not just doing whatever I want, but actively choosing my path? How do I figure out which path is mine?**

**A:** That’s where it gets interesting. There’s a two-step process for discovering true freedom:

1. **First, you question the paths you’ve been shown.**  
    Are they really yours, or were they imposed on you by society, family, culture, or your circumstances? Are they just illusions of freedom?
    
    Many of us live on “default paths” set by others—paths that say, “Get a degree, find a job, make money, buy a house, and be happy.” But these might not be authentic to you. Freedom begins when you stop and say, “Wait, is this really my path? Or am I just following what others expect of me?”
    
2. **Then, you choose to believe in the path you truly want.**  
    This isn’t about what’s “right” or “wrong” in a universal sense—it’s about what resonates with you. True freedom comes when you stop walking paths defined by others and start walking one defined by your own doubts, beliefs, and dreams.

#### **Q: But what if I choose the wrong path? What if my decisions turn out to be mistakes?**

**A:** Here’s the thing: **there’s no universal right or wrong path.** That’s one of the hardest truths to accept, but it’s also liberating. What matters is whether your path feels authentic to you.

Mistakes will happen—life’s full of them. But if you’re walking a path you truly chose, those mistakes become part of your story, not something imposed on you. And isn’t that better than living a life where you never questioned anything, only to wake up one day realizing you were following someone else’s dream?

True freedom isn’t about avoiding mistakes. It’s about owning them.

#### **Q: That makes sense. But it still feels scary to step off the “default path.” What if it leads to nowhere?**

**A:** That fear is valid. Breaking away from the “default” often feels like stepping into the unknown. But here’s the thing: **freedom is scary, but it’s also powerful.**

When you choose your own path—when you own your doubts and your beliefs—you’re living authentically. Even if it’s a lonely road, even if it’s a difficult one, it’s **yours.** And that’s where true meaning comes from: knowing that your life is shaped by your choices, not someone else’s.

The philosopher Sartre said it best: **“Man is condemned to be free.”** Freedom can feel like a burden because it forces us to take responsibility for our lives. But it’s also the source of our greatest power: the ability to create meaning in a world that doesn’t hand it to us.

#### **Q: Okay, but let’s say I doubt everything—my career, my relationships, even the world around me. What’s the point of it all?**

**A:** I hear you. This is where a lot of people get stuck in what we call “existential doubt” or “the void.” When you start questioning everything, it feels like nothing matters. But here’s the twist: **it’s in doubt that you find your strength.**

Doubt isn’t your enemy—it’s your greatest tool. By doubting, you tear down what’s false and discover what’s true for you. Through doubt, you reconstruct your own reality.

Here’s a perspective I love: “I think, therefore I am” (Descartes’ famous phrase). It’s not just about existing—it’s about the power of your mind to question and confirm your own existence. In doubting, you’re already alive. In doubting, you’re already free.

---

#### **Q: So freedom comes from doubt? That’s... ironic. I thought freedom was about certainty.**

**A:** It’s a beautiful irony, isn’t it? True freedom starts with doubt because doubt frees you from illusions. But freedom isn’t just doubting—it’s also **believing in what’s left after the doubt.**

Think of it this way:

1. Doubt helps you clear away the lies, illusions, and “default paths” in your life. It’s like clearing a cluttered room to see what’s really inside.
2. Belief helps you rebuild. Once you’ve cleared away what’s fake, you choose what to keep and what to build upon.

The result? A life that’s uniquely, authentically yours.

#### **Q: That sounds powerful. But what if others judge me for walking my own path?**

**A:** Let’s be honest—people will judge you. Society loves to judge those who step off the “default path.” But here’s the thing: **their judgment doesn’t matter. Your freedom does.**

The philosopher Nietzsche once said, “The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe.” Walking your own path isn’t about pleasing the crowd—it’s about staying true to yourself.

Even if your road is lonely, even if you fail by society’s standards, you’ll know deep down that you lived authentically. That’s something no one can take from you.

---

#### **Q: So, how do I know I’m truly free?**

**A:** You’ll know you’re free when you can say this to yourself:

- “I’ve questioned everything I’ve been told.”
- “I’ve cleared away the paths that aren’t mine.”
- “I’ve chosen my own road, even if it’s hard, even if it’s scary.”
- “I believe in this path—not because others told me to, but because it’s what I truly want.”

Freedom isn’t about perfection. It’s about **walking forward on your chosen road, even with doubts in your heart.**

---

#### **Q: Any final thoughts?**

**A:** Yes—let me summarize with this: **Freedom is not given to you. It’s something you create.** It’s not about doing what others expect or following the safest route. It’s about having the courage to doubt, the strength to believe, and the will to act.

True freedom isn’t just being able to say, “I can do what I want.” It’s being able to say, **“I am guiding myself toward my own path, one step at a time, no matter what.”**

So, my friend, ask yourself: **What path feels true to you? What road are you ready to walk, even if no one else understands it?** When you find that answer—when you believe in it—you’ll know what freedom truly is.
