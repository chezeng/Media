*As I sit here, bathed in the glow of my computer screen, I can't help but be transported back to the dawn of the new millennium. It was a time of unbridled optimism, a world poised on the brink of unprecedented technological advancement, yet still clinging to the comforting embrace of tradition. We stood at the crossroads of centuries, one foot in the past, one in the future, our hearts full of hope and wonder.*

*As information technology burgeoned, our knowledge expanded exponentially. We gained access to a wealth of information that our parents could only dream of. Our lives became more convenient, more connected, more *efficient*. But amidst this progress, a question nags at me: Are we truly happier?*

*In my mind's eye, I can still see that childhood room. Sunlight filtering through thin curtains, casting a warm glow on my computer screen. Dust motes dance in the air, lending a tangible realness to the scene. The familiar chime of Windows 7 starting up, the simple joy of playing games on small websites, the vibrant discussions on Reddit, the endless creativity on Youtube. Everything was in its prime, untouched by the complexities that would come later.*

*It was a moment of perfect balance - the old world and the new, coexisting in harmony. We had just enough technology to enhance our lives, but not so much that it overwhelmed us. Information was a tool, not a burden. Social media connected us without consuming us. It was, perhaps, the best of both worlds.*
