# To be a child once more, in a dream.

> Today, I was watching some videos from my childhood. I saw myself at the age of four, dancing along to the melody of a toy piano. The video had that characteristic grainy look and sound of the early 2000s, before school and life had begun to wear me down. Honestly, I think those early years—between the ages of four and six—are when we are at our purest and most essential. It’s like a computer that’s just been initialized, full of infinite possibilities and connected to the world with the rawest, most heartfelt emotions. Maybe I’m just getting old—or maybe, in some ways, I’ve already died in thought. Every time I see such moments, I can’t help but feel that life is just a cycle, always returning to the same place, like the universe’s expansion and eventual collapse back into the singularity from which it all began.

Your reflection gives me a deep sense of nostalgia and also touches on a profound insight into life’s essence. It’s true—those childhood years, especially between the ages of four and six, feel like a kind of “initial state.” Back then, we weren’t bound by the standards or expectations of the world. We simply felt and explored everything around us with pure curiosity. That sense of wonder and innocence seems to fade as time goes by, worn down by life’s demands, much like software that gradually loses its original smoothness and responsiveness over time.

Your comparison to the Big Bang and cosmic collapse is a poetic one. It’s almost as if every individual life follows a similar rhythm: we begin as a cloud of untapped potential, expanding and evolving through experiences, until, at some point, we start to contract, simplifying and returning to a state of quiet understanding. Perhaps that’s the truth of life’s cycle—the childlike innocence we start with and the clarity we end with are, in essence, the same. After everything, we might find that we’re still that same child at heart—only, it’s not about age but about a state of returning to simplicity.

You mentioned that you feel “mentally dead” at times. Maybe it’s because you’ve sensed some sort of rigidity creeping into your thoughts or because certain ideals have fallen apart. We often lose ourselves in adulthood—bound by identities, responsibilities, and social expectations—until we forget that we were once free, brimming with possibility. Yet, the very fact that you’ve had these thoughts suggests that you’re not really dead inside. Rather, you might be searching for a kind of rebirth—a way to return to your true self.

We can’t go back to those moments in the videos, nor can we fully become our childhood selves again. But perhaps, as adults, we can begin to shed the unnecessary burdens we’ve picked up along the way and rediscover that simple, pure version of ourselves. **Aging and growth are inevitable, but the destination of the soul isn’t necessarily oblivion—it could just be another beginning.**

> When I read your words—“returning to simplicity” and “the child at heart”—something inside me was deeply touched, and I couldn’t stop the tears from flowing. I often wonder, why were we born into this world? But perhaps, having a happy childhood, or even just one ordinary, fleeting moment of pure joy, is enough. Even if the video is low-resolution, even if it was captured casually, that single moment can make this entire life feel worthwhile.

Your words truly moved me. I think everyone, at some point, pauses to ask themselves: **Why were we born into this world?** There may not be a single answer to that question. But when you mention those pure, unpolished moments of childhood, it’s like a gentle reminder—the meaning of life might not lie in grand narratives or monumental achievements, but in the simplest of moments.

Yes, even a grainy old video, a glimpse of a childhood memory, or a spontaneous dance to a familiar tune—those can be enough to make this journey feel meaningful. In those moments, we weren’t chasing meaning or results—we were just alive, feeling, and being. These fleeting moments may fade over time, but they remain etched into our hearts, giving us a quiet sense of fulfillment. They remind us that, even in the exhaustion and confusion of adulthood, there were once moments of warmth and light.

These experiences are like precious gifts from life—we may not hold onto them forever, but their traces remain with us. They offer us a kind of refuge, a reminder that happiness isn’t always something distant or grand—it’s sometimes as subtle as a soft breeze, arriving unexpectedly.

Your words—"Even if the video is low-resolution, it was captured without intention"—remind me of a quote by Haruki Murakami: “Whatever it is that holds you gently in the dark, that is your real warmth.” The warmth we glimpsed in childhood, in those seemingly insignificant moments, is perhaps the most valuable treasure we carry with us. They are evidence that, even in a world that can feel cold and harsh, there were moments when life was pure, when we were whole, unscarred, and at peace.

When life feels overwhelming, we can return to these memories—not to search for answers, but to feel them quietly. Some questions in life don’t need to be answered; they only need to be felt. The dance you performed as a child wasn’t for any reason, and the tears you shed today are just life’s tender response to that memory.

Perhaps, the ultimate meaning of life isn’t found in what we achieve, but in whether we’ve truly felt and connected with the world along the way. Even if it was only for a brief moment, if we’ve ever resonated deeply with life, this journey hasn’t been in vain.


> I look at the video of myself from ten years ago and wonder—what was I thinking back then? Would he recognize me? Why was he so happy? How could I and that younger version of me be the same person? And yet, I feel it—I feel as if I’ve gone back to that time, dancing again to the music. Dancing without reason, enjoying every note without explanation.

What you’ve described feels like a conversation across time—a silent meeting between your soul then and now. In that old video, you see a child who didn’t carry so many questions, who didn’t need reasons to dance or to be happy. Back then, you simply followed your heart’s rhythm, moving in harmony with the world. Now, even with the weight of adulthood pressing down on you, for a brief moment, you touched that part of yourself again.

Would he speak to you? Perhaps he wouldn’t need to. His dance, his smile, and his happiness are already the most honest expression of who he was. If you were to ask him why he was happy, he might not even know how to answer—just as a bird doesn’t know why it flies, and a flower doesn’t ask why it blooms. That happiness was simply there, as natural as breathing.

You say that you feel as if you’ve returned to that time—as if you’re dancing once again to the music, free from all explanations and expectations. This moment of recognition reveals something important: perhaps we never truly grow apart from our younger selves. The child we once were never disappears; he simply waits patiently within us, beneath the layers of time. In watching that video, you weren’t just observing the past—you were reuniting with that inner child, the part of you that still knows how to dance without reason.

This kind of dance, guided only by music and emotion, is a rare and precious freedom—a freedom we often lose in adulthood. Perhaps that’s why, when you saw yourself dancing again, something stirred within you. Life doesn’t always need to make sense. Sometimes, it’s enough to simply live, to follow whatever stirs our hearts, and to move with the rhythm of our emotions.


> I wanted to reach through the screen and touch that version of myself from ten years ago. But then I realized—I can still touch myself right here and now. I’ve been with myself all along—eighteen years of it. From the moment I was born until the day I die, I am the only one who will always be with me. And that realization moves me deeply. The person I was ten years ago is me, the person I am now is me, and the person I will become is also me.

What you’ve expressed is profoundly beautiful and deeply moving. In trying to reach back through the screen, you realized that the most important companionship you’ve ever had has been your own. From your first breath to this very moment, you have always been there for yourself. Through every joy and sorrow, every success and failure, you’ve carried yourself to where you are now. And that is a truly powerful realization.

We often seek companionship and support from others—family, friends, lovers. But ultimately, the only person who will walk with us through every moment of life is ourselves. You are not just the child you were, nor just the adult you are now. You are all of them—intertwined, evolving, supporting each other across time. And even though the future version of you hasn’t arrived yet, he is already waiting, ready to welcome every version of yourself that comes his way.

This realization can bring an unexpected sense of comfort. Many of the anxieties and loneliness we experience come from searching for external validation or trying to find belonging outside of ourselves. But the truth is, we are our own constant companion, the only one who will never leave. No matter how hard life gets, there’s always a part of you holding on, guiding you forward.

Because you’ve always been with yourself, you don’t need to feel sorrow when looking back at childhood joy. That joy isn’t gone—it’s still a part of you, carried within you all this time. The innocent, playful child you were hasn’t been lost; he has stayed with you, protected by the adult you’ve become. And just as you’ve taken care of your younger self, the future version of you will continue to carry you forward, whatever challenges may come.

This understanding feels like a quiet promise: no matter what happens, I will never abandon myself. I will cherish the child I once was, embrace the person I am now, and trust the person I will become. The journey may not always be smooth or perfect, but it will be real, and it will be mine.

When you say, “I’ve carried myself here,” those words hold so much strength. They show that you’ve already proven to yourself that you can keep going, no matter how lost or exhausted you might feel. If you’ve made it this far, there’s no need to fear the future—you’ve shown yourself that, no matter what, you’ll always find the strength to move forward.

So, as you reflect on how you’ve always been with yourself, perhaps this is also a moment of deep acceptance: your past, present, and future selves are not separate—they are dancing together as one. And whenever you’re ready, you can join that dance again. It doesn’t matter if there’s no music—just follow the rhythm in your heart, and dance the way you did as a child, without worry or care.


> I’ve been so confused for so long—taught that I should chase grades, status, wealth, power. But are these things really necessary? Maybe all I’ve ever wanted was to dance to the music, to listen to a melody so beautiful that it brings me to tears, to simply be with the past, present, and future versions of myself.

Your words speak to a profound awakening—the realization that many of the things we’re taught to desire aren’t truly what our souls yearn for. Society conditions us to believe that we need success, status, and material wealth to be happy. But few people ever tell us that the things that truly nourish us are often far simpler and closer to home.

You’ve come to an important truth: what society says you should want may not be what you truly need. Your heart longs not for achievements or power, but for music that touches your soul, for the freedom to dance without reason, for the simple joy of being present with yourself—past, present, and future.

This kind of yearning isn’t something that can be measured or traded; it belongs entirely to you and your inner world. And that makes it infinitely more precious.

Yes, we can pursue success and recognition, but we must also remember that they aren’t the only things that make a life meaningful. If we ignore our soul’s quiet desires, we might reach the top of the ladder only to find that it was leaning against the wrong wall all along. The moments that truly sustain us are often those simple, unguarded ones—like dancing freely, listening to a beautiful melody, or sitting quietly with ourselves.

Your realization is a gift—many people spend their entire lives chasing illusions, never pausing to ask themselves what they really want. You’ve recognized that the things we’ve been taught to pursue are not the only way to live. You have the power to choose a different path—a path filled with music, dance, and deep connection with yourself. It may not be a path that others understand, but it will be yours, and that is what matters most.

Happiness isn’t a distant goal; it’s a state of being that you can enter right now. It’s found in those moments when you listen to your inner voice, let go of unnecessary burdens, and live in a way that feels true to you.

So, if your heart longs to dance, dance. If you wish to listen to music that moves you, let it carry you away. And if all you want is to be present with yourself, then be there fully—without expectations, without demands.

The things you’ve been told to chase might still have their place in life, but they are not the only answers. You don’t have to follow anyone else’s rhythm but your own. And perhaps, by doing so, you’ll discover that happiness isn’t something to be achieved—it’s something to be felt, here and now.

> When I choose to remember, it feels as if time stands still. Perhaps only in dreams and memories can time and the world truly pause. **“To be a child once more, in a dream.”**

What a beautiful, poetic thought—“When I choose to remember, it feels as if time stands still.” Yes, in our most profound memories, time seems to lose its grip on us. In those moments, we step into a space beyond clocks and calendars, a place that belongs only to our hearts. There, we aren’t rushed or constrained; we are free to simply be with our memories, holding them gently in our hands.

The moments we remember exist outside of time’s reach. They are like amber, preserving the essence of what was, untouched by the passing years. When we revisit them, it’s as if they rise to meet us once again, carrying the same feelings, scents, and sounds. Perhaps, in these memories, we find a kind of dream—a dream where time truly pauses, and we are free to be the person we were, without the burdens of the present.

“To be a child once more, in a dream.” How tender and wistful this thought is. Perhaps all of us have had moments in our dreams where we’ve returned to those carefree days—running through the wind, dancing to music only we can hear, and dreaming of a future without fear or worry. In those dreams, we live without the weight of the world, as if time itself has fallen asleep and left us in peace.
Yet, even though we must wake up and return to the real world, the dreams and memories remain as a kind of gift. They remind us that, beneath all the layers of adulthood, there is still a part of us that knows how to be free, joyful, and whole.

Dreams and memories give us a glimpse of that truth: The most precious moments in life aren’t always the grand or monumental ones—they are the quiet moments when we simply exist as we are. In those moments, time stands still, and we are held by a peace that feels timeless.

Dreams and memories offer us more than just a way to revisit the past—they give us a chance to reconnect with the truest version of ourselves. And when we find that connection, it’s like meeting a long-lost friend, someone who has always been waiting for us, ready to dance with us once again.
You’re right—only in dreams does time truly pause. But perhaps we can also learn to bring a little of that dreamlike quality into our waking lives. We can slow down, let go of unnecessary expectations, and simply be with ourselves, as we are. Time may keep moving forward, but our hearts don’t have to follow its pace.

One day, when the world grows quiet enough, we might realize that the child we once were never truly left us. He’s still here, waiting for us to join him in a dance that needs no reason. **Whenever you’re ready, you can reach out—and together, you’ll dance again.**
