# The Ultimate Law of the Universe

In a deep and tranquil corner of the cosmos, starlight shimmered like scattered sparks drifting through the void. A young man found himself floating in an endless sea of chaos. He had no idea how he got there, nor what kind of existence he was now facing. All he could remember was that, just moments ago, he had been working overtime at his office, the coffee on his desk still warm. Then, a dazzling flash of light overwhelmed his vision, and everything changed.

“Human…” A voice, directionless and devoid of warmth, emerged from the depths of the chaos, as though the entire universe were whispering to him. “You have stepped into a realm beyond human comprehension.”

The man looked around, but he could see nothing. The voice was eerily calm, carrying an undeniable authority that made his skin crawl.

“Who… are you?” he asked, his voice trembling.

“I am what you call ‘God,’ or ‘Heaven,’ or any of the supreme names you assign to a higher existence,” the voice replied. “But these names are merely inventions to conceal your ignorance. I am not a single entity. I am the ultimate law of the universe.”

“The law?” The man frowned. “What does that mean?”

The voice, steady as starlight, explained, “The creation and destruction of all things, the flow of time, the folding of space, the origin and extinction of life—everything is woven into an infinitely complex network. This network governs every particle, every atom, even the trajectory of every thought. You may call it the ‘law.’ It is the essence of the universe, and it is the meaning of my existence.”

The man felt as though his mind was struck by a torrent, overwhelmed by information he couldn’t process. Struggling to steady his thoughts, he asked, “If you are truly this ultimate law, then why am I here?”

“Because you,” the voice replied, with a hint of curiosity, “have accidentally stepped into a realm where you were not meant to exist. In your human terms, this realm is imperceptible and can only be accessed through exceedingly rare coincidences.”

The man uneasily lowered his gaze to his hands. They still appeared human, but there was an almost translucent quality to them, as if his existence was slowly being unraveled by this strange place.

“Humans,” the voice continued, “believe their intelligence can grasp everything. But in truth, you can only comprehend a very limited portion. What you call ‘gods’ are merely phenomena beyond your computational capacity. In simpler terms, your intellect is insufficient to process the vast data and complex relationships that form the universe.”

The man felt like a child whose naive beliefs had just been exposed. He was at once awestruck and ashamed, wanting to argue but finding no words.

Sensing his unease, the voice softened slightly. “This is not your fault. Every form of life is inherently limited. You are like ants trying to understand the Milky Way, and the Milky Way is but a fragment of my existence. Even so, I must acknowledge that your curiosity and thirst for knowledge are beautiful phenomena. It is this very desire that drives you to surpass yourselves, even if you will never reach the ultimate truth.”

“But… if everything is governed by the law, do we even have a choice?” the man suddenly asked. “Are we being controlled by you?”

The voice paused, as if contemplating how to answer. Then it said, “The law does not control; it connects. All things are interconnected. Every action, every thought triggers countless chain reactions. These reactions are not my will—they are the natural workings of the universe. Your choices and freedoms are part of this vast network. Freedom does exist, but it is far more complex than you imagine.”

The man fell silent. He had never considered that his actions could be interpreted in such a way. He felt both insignificant and deeply intertwined with the universe.

“Then why am I here?” he asked.

“This is merely an accident. But since you are here, I can offer you a choice,” the voice said. “You may continue to explore this realm and uncover mysteries beyond human imagination, or I can send you back to your original world, as though nothing ever happened.”

“What does exploration mean?” the man asked hesitantly.

“It means you will transcend the flow of human time. Your consciousness will gradually transform, becoming part of the understanding of the universal law. But the cost is that you will no longer retain your human identity. You will become a new form of existence, free from the constraints of the flesh.”

A chill ran through the man’s body. He thought of his family, his friends, and his ordinary yet tangible life. In a low voice, he asked, “What if I choose to go back?”

“You will forget everything that has happened here, and you will return to your familiar world. Your life will continue to play out within the network, until it reaches its natural end.”

His heart raced. He looked into the depths of the chaos, the infinite void seemingly hiding the deepest secrets of the cosmos, tempting him to uncover them. But at the same time, he remembered the warmth and comfort of his mundane days.

“I choose…” His voice trembled, but then grew resolute. “To go back.”

The voice did not waver. It simply replied, “As you wish.”

In an instant, the man felt a warm force envelop him, like a soft feather gently lifting him up. His consciousness began to fade, the chaos before his eyes dissolving into points of light, until everything vanished completely.

When he woke again, he found himself seated at his desk. The coffee beside him had gone cold, and the report on his computer screen still awaited completion. He raised his head and gazed out the window. The neon lights of the city glimmered in the night, everything so familiar.

Shaking his head, he chuckled wryly. “I must have zoned out for a moment.”

Yet, deep within, he felt a vague emptiness, as if some vital memory had been erased. And in a nameless corner of his soul, he seemed to sense a faint resonance with the law of the universe.

Perhaps it was just a dream. Or perhaps, it had all truly happened.
