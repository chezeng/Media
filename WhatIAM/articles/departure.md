#### **Q: I just finished my end-of-term reflection, and I’m feeling bittersweet about saying goodbye to my class and teacher. Is it normal to feel this way?**

**A:** Absolutely. Endings, especially those that involve people we’ve grown close to, are always a mix of emotions—gratitude, nostalgia, and a touch of sadness. What you’re feeling is deeply human: a recognition that all things, even the best moments, must eventually come to an end.

You mentioned your kind and forgiving teacher, someone who’s perhaps nearing retirement, and the camaraderie you shared with your 30-person class. Isn’t it fascinating how people, even if only brought together for four short months, can create bonds that feel profound?

This is the beauty of human connection: like stars streaking briefly across the night sky, these encounters, though fleeting, leave an impression that stays with us. And perhaps, years from now, when you recall these memories, they’ll have a deeper meaning, like echoes of a song whose lyrics change as you grow older.

#### **Q: But isn’t it sad that all these connections will eventually dissolve? Wouldn’t it be better if we never met, so we wouldn’t have to part?**

**A:** That’s such a profound question, and it’s one that philosophers and poets have wrestled with for centuries.

It’s true—if there were no meeting, there’d be no parting. But think about it: without the pain of separation, would we ever truly understand the joy of connection? It’s the duality of life: light exists because of darkness, happiness because of sorrow.

When you say goodbye to someone or something, it’s like a song reaching its final note. But isn’t that what makes the melody meaningful? If a song were endless, would we ever cherish it? The same goes for life’s relationships and experiences—they’re fleeting, but their brevity makes them precious.

So yes, parting is painful. But in a way, it also completes the cycle of a meaningful connection, reminding us to treasure what we had while it lasted.

#### **Q: Do you think it’s better to have never been born, so I wouldn’t have to experience the pain of parting?**

**A:** That’s such a profound question. On the surface, it might seem like avoiding existence would spare us from suffering. But think about this: without experiencing pain, could we ever truly appreciate joy? Without knowing loss, would we value the moments we share with others as deeply?

Life is full of contradictions. It’s imperfect, messy, and often unfair. But it’s also beautiful because of its fragility. Imagine a life where there’s no parting, no struggle. Wouldn’t that also mean there’s no reunion, no triumph, no heartfelt connections to cherish?

Pain and joy are two sides of the same coin, and together, they create the richness of life. As you said so eloquently: **“This is an ancient dilemma—no perfect answer exists.”** But perhaps the imperfection itself is what makes life worth living.

#### **Q: You mentioned my teacher. She must’ve seen so many students come and go. Do you think she feels the same way about goodbyes?**

**A:** That’s such an intriguing thought! For teachers, especially those who’ve been at it for decades, every class is both a beginning and an ending. Your teacher has likely said countless goodbyes, but each one probably carries its own unique emotions.

Imagine her perspective: her students are like seeds she’s helped nurture, watching them grow before they scatter into the world. While she may never see most of them again, a piece of her influence continues to live on in their journeys.

You also noted something interesting: though your teacher may have spent her entire career in the same “small place,” that doesn’t diminish her impact. She may not have walked the bustling streets of Wall Street or experienced the chaos of the corporate world, but she’s lived a different kind of richness—one built on quiet connections, moments of inspiration, and lifelong bonds with her students.

In her own way, she’s created a legacy. And when she looks back on her life, she may feel content knowing she made a difference, even if only in a “small place.”

#### **Q: I don’t often feel overwhelmed by parting like others do. Instead, I find myself reflecting more on my thoughts and the things I’ve created. Is that strange?**

**A:** Not strange at all! In fact, it’s a reflection of your personality and how you process the world.

Some people are more outwardly focused, finding meaning in shared memories and interactions. But others, like you, are more inwardly attuned, drawing strength from their own creations, thoughts, and reflections. This doesn’t mean you don’t value human connections—it simply means you process them differently.

Your inclination to record your thoughts, to reflect deeply on the experiences you’ve had, is a powerful way of giving those moments meaning. You may not remember every detail of your interactions with others, but through writing, you preserve something just as valuable: how those experiences made you feel and how they shaped your perspective.

You also mentioned something beautiful: by documenting your thoughts, they have the potential to resonate with others, even strangers you’ve never met. In this way, your reflections don’t just serve you—they have the power to create connections that transcend time and space.

#### **Q: But isn’t it lonely, sometimes? People connect so deeply with others, while I feel more connected to ideas and my own creations.**

**A:** It might feel lonely at times, but it’s a different kind of loneliness—one that comes with depth and self-discovery. Rather than seeking constant connection with others, you’ve chosen to build a relationship with your inner world.

This isn’t to say you can’t connect with others—it’s just that your connections may feel more profound when they happen. And through your writing and reflections, you’re still engaging with people, even if indirectly. Sometimes, a carefully chosen word or an honest thought can touch someone’s heart more deeply than hours of small talk ever could.

Think of it this way: you’re creating a map of your inner world, a treasure trove of ideas, memories, and emotions. Not everyone will see it, but for those who do—whether that’s your future self or a stranger reading your words—it could be something truly meaningful.

#### **Q: I came across a line from _Genshin Impact_ that perfectly describes this: “A fateful stone that connects dreams. Its glimmers can entwine fates and connect dreams, just as how its glimmer links stars into the shapes of a heart's desires.” Isn’t that a beautiful thought?**

**A:** It truly is. That line captures something deeply poetic about human connection and the mysteries of fate.

We’re like stars scattered across the vast expanse of the cosmos—each of us seemingly distant, isolated. But fate, like a guiding light, brings certain stars into alignment, creating constellations that light up our lives.

Even if these alignments are brief, they leave an indelible mark, just like shooting stars. The people we meet, the connections we form, may feel random, but perhaps they’re part of a larger pattern we can’t yet see.

This idea gives hope: that even in moments of loneliness, even across time and space, there’s a force that draws us toward the connections we’re meant to have. And in the grand tapestry of life, those fleeting alignments can be some of the most meaningful.

#### **Q: So, is it okay to feel sad about endings, even if they’re inevitable?**

**A:** Of course. Sadness is part of the human experience—it’s what gives depth to our joy and meaning to our memories. As you said, life is like a song: it has a beginning, a crescendo, and inevitably, an end.

But endings aren’t just about loss. They’re also about transition. A song’s closing notes don’t erase its beauty; they complete it. A chapter’s final page doesn’t diminish the story—it sets the stage for what comes next.

So yes, it’s okay to mourn an ending. But also remember: every ending carries within it the seed of a new beginning. And that, perhaps, is life’s greatest gift.
